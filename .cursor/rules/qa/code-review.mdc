# Code Review Rules

## Code Review Philosophy

### 1. Review Checklist

```typescript
// Pre-Review Checklist
interface CodeReviewChecklist {
  // Functionality
  functionality: {
    correctness: boolean // Does the code do what it's supposed to?
    edgeCases: boolean // Are edge cases handled?
    errorHandling: boolean // Are errors properly handled?
    performance: boolean // Are there performance concerns?
  }
  
  // Code Quality
  quality: {
    readability: boolean // Is the code easy to understand?
    maintainability: boolean // Can others maintain this code?
    testability: boolean // Is the code testable?
    documentation: boolean // Is it properly documented?
  }
  
  // Architecture
  architecture: {
    patterns: boolean // Does it follow established patterns?
    dependencies: boolean // Are dependencies appropriate?
    coupling: boolean // Is coupling minimized?
    cohesion: boolean // Is cohesion maximized?
  }
  
  // Security
  security: {
    authentication: boolean // Auth properly implemented?
    authorization: boolean // Permissions checked?
    validation: boolean // Inputs validated?
    secrets: boolean // No hardcoded secrets?
  }
}
```
