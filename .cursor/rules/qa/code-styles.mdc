# Lint & Formatting Rules (MANDATORY)

These rules are NOT suggestions.
Any violation is considered a tooling or architectural error.

This document exists to prevent:

- Tool churn
- AI-induced formatting noise
- ESLint / Prettier conflicts
- Accidental architecture drift

---

## 1. Responsibility Separation (CRITICAL)

Linting and formatting are separate concerns.

### ESLint

ESLint is responsible for:

- Code correctness
- Architectural rules
- React / React Native best practices
- Anti-pattern detection

### Prettier

Prettier is responsible for:

- Formatting ONLY
- Whitespace, indentation, line breaks, quotes

---

## 2. Prettier Policy (IDE-ONLY)

Prettier MUST be used ONLY as an editor formatter.

### Allowed

- Prettier formatting on save (IDE)
- Manual Prettier CLI usage

### Forbidden

- `eslint-plugin-prettier`
- `prettier/prettier` ESLint rule
- ESLint failing CI or commits due to formatting
- AI tools reintroducing Prettier into ESLint

If formatting is required:
→ Let the IDE handle it.

---

## 3. ESLint Policy (BLOCKING)

ESLint is a blocking gate in:

- Husky pre-commit
- lint-staged
- CI pipelines

### Rule severity meaning

- `error` → MUST be fixed before commit
- `warn` → Does NOT block commit

AI tools MUST NOT downgrade errors to warnings.

---

## 4. React Native–Specific Rules

### react-native/sort-styles

- Severity: `error`
- MUST be enforced
- Style properties MUST be ordered consistently

### react-native/no-inline-styles

- Severity: `warn`
- Inline styles are tolerated in:
  - MVP phase
  - Simple UI components
  - Non-performance-critical paths

AI tools MUST NOT refactor inline styles unless explicitly requested.

---

## 5. Husky & lint-staged Rules

- lint-staged failures MUST block commits
- lint-staged reverting files is expected behavior

### Forbidden actions

AI tools MUST NOT:

- Disable lint rules to pass commits
- Suggest `--no-verify`
- Bypass Husky hooks
